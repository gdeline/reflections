Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A: quickly highlighted the changed lines

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: Can see how things have changed over time, including when others have made mods.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
A: pro: tied to logical events/changes - more likely to be meaningful; con: potential for human error if forget to do this (e.g. wipe out file and can't find older version)

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: the purpose for the two tools is different.  the former is for s/w dev where files are interrelated based on the changes, and the latter for discreet document management

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: Log to see the commits that have occured at a higher level then diff to see what exactly changed in the files.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A: can effectively "undo" them

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A: support future dev work
